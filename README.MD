Everything is set up on the mygoldsmiths server 
But if you want to do it locally first create the sql tables by running tables.sql and sp_insert_orderx.sql on mysql
In your terminal do npm install express ejs body-parser express-session express-validator mysql express-sanitizer bcrypt 

Create a user to access the order food
or use this user:
Username : userone
Password : password123
